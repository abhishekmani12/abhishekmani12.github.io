Hi there! I'm a **Data Science enthusiast** currently working as a **Software Developer/Analyst** at a cybersecurity startup. I usually work with Linux servers and scripting languages like Python and shell to do various backend tasks. 

Apart from work, I try to learn about new machine learning and deep learning concepts and approaches to keep myself up to date in this field as I'm passionate about it. I implement what I've learned and read, through various projects to build my skills.

In my downtime, I like to travel, cycle, and take photos. Feel free to connect through any of my linked socials.
